All data are organized within the code directory and structured as follows:

1datapre:
Temperature prediction results for the test set using three thermal models on the first dataset with 2-channel input.

2datapre:
Temperature prediction results for the test set using five thermal models on the second dataset with 3-channel input.

2datainverse:

HTCinverse: Accuracy and efficiency of heat transfer coefficient (HTC) estimation using the proposed deep neural network–based inverse algorithm.

powerinverse: Accuracy and efficiency of power map estimation using the proposed deep neural network–based inverse algorithm.

3datapre:
Temperature prediction results for the test set using five thermal models on the third dataset.

3datainverse:
